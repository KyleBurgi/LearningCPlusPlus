Learning C++ the long way with the help of learncpp.com

This is my journey in learning C++. This consists of small programs for now and will slowly branch in the future to larger and larger projects as I become more comfortable.

1. HelloWorld - It prints Hello World!
2. PracticeOne - Simple add program that takes in user input
3. PracticeTwo - Takes PracticeOne and breaks it into functions
